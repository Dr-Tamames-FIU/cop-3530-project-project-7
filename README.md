Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository contains a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java.



Notes:
   Ensure you have Java installed on your device.
    
   This program is designed to run in a console or terminal environment.
    
   If you encounter any issues, please check your Java installation and ensure that the terminal supports user input.



How to Run the Program:

1. Clone the Repository

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

3. Run the main: TicTacToeEngine

4. Follow the On-Screen Instructions:
    
    Enter the name for Player 1 (Single name like first name. Ex: Billy).

    Enter the name for Player 2 (Single name like first name. Ex: Janie).
    
    The game will prompt each player to make moves in turns, starting with Player 1 as 'X' and so forth.

    When playing the game it will ask you to input "enter your move (row and column)". Please input information as asked for, in this case a numerical value and/or integer with a space in between, not together or with a comma seperating it. (Ex: 1 1) or (Ex: 3 2)

5. Game Result:

    The game will announce the winner if there is one.
    
    If the game ends in a draw, it will display a draw message.

6. Replay:

    After the game ends, you will be prompted to play again.
    
    Type "yes" to start a new game or "no" to exit and end the program.


Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
